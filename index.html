  <main class="card" id="card"> <h1>Hey Deepshikha  💖</h1>
 <!-- each paragraph will be revealed line-by-line -->
   <div class="body-text">I don’t even know where to start… maybe because there’s so much I want to say, and none of it feels enough when it comes to you. You know, it’s strange — how in such a short time, someone can start meaning so much. You came into my life like a calm breeze, and before I knew it, everything around me felt a little lighter, a little warmer.</div>
    <div class="body-text">But then life happened. And I know the pain you’ve been through isn’t something words can fix. Losing someone you love… it leaves a silence that echoes inside. It changes how you look at everything. And when you said “I don’t deserve love,” it hit me hard — because if there’s anyone who truly deserves to be loved, cared for, and protected, it’s you.</div>
 <div class="body-text">You know, there’s this line from The Perks of Being a Wallflower — “We accept the love we think we deserve.” Maybe you’ve stopped believing you deserve something good. But I see you, Deep — every little thing that makes you who you are. The way your voice softens when you care, how your humor hides your pain, how you still try to smile through it all. You’re made of kindness and chaos, of dreams and strength. You just need someone to remind you — you’re still allowed to be happy.</div>
 <div class="body-text">And maybe that’s what I want to be… that reminder. Not as someone expecting anything from you, not to fix you, not to make you love me — but just to be there. To stand quietly beside you, to make sure you don’t feel alone when life feels too heavy.</div>
 <div class="body-text">You once said you have a dangerously good sense of humor and a soft heart — and that’s exactly what makes you special. Don’t let pain convince you that you’re broken. You’re not. You’re just human… beautifully human.</div>
 <div class="body-text">There’s a line that says — “You’re not perfect, and I’ll save you the suspense — I’m not either. But the question is, are we perfect for each other?” I don’t want perfect, Deep. I want real. I want to be around when you laugh uncontrollably, and when you fall silent for no reason. I want to listen to your favorite songs, even when they’re sad. I want to see you smile when you talk about your dreams again — those big dreams, those wings you once believed you had.</div>
 <div class="body-text">“You only get one life. It’s your duty to live it as fully as possible.” You still have that life waiting for you — music to sing, places to see, mornings that will someday feel gentle again.</div>
 <div class="body-text">I know you’re scared. I know it’s hard to trust life again. But sometimes, even in brokenness, something beautiful can grow. Like that quote from The Notebook: “It wasn’t over. It still isn’t over.” Because sometimes, love doesn’t demand anything — it just quietly stays, holding your hand even when you pull it away.</div>
 <div class="body-text">And if you ask me what I want — it’s simple. I just want to be there for you. When you need a friend, when you feel low, when you need to vent about life — or when you just want someone to remind you that you still matter.</div>
 <div class="body-text">I don’t want to be someone who disappears when things get tough. I want to be the one who stays. Who listens. Who believes in you even when you stop believing in yourself.</div>
 <div class="body-text">“All you gotta do is trust me.” Just trust that I mean every word I say.</div>
 <div class="body-text">You don’t have to love me back. You don’t have to promise me anything. Just let me care for you, in silence if that’s what you need. Because I truly mean it — when you smile again, when your eyes light up again, that’ll be enough for me.</div>
 <div class="body-text">Deepshikha, you’re not someone I just like — you’re someone I feel deeply connected to. You make me want to be gentle, to be patient, to be someone worth having in your life.</div>
 <div class="body-text">So don’t shut the world out completely. Let a little light in. Let me be part of that light, even if it’s just for a while.</div>
 <div class="body-text">You don’t have to face everything alone. You’ve got someone here who genuinely cares — not out of pity, not out of sympathy, but out of love… real, quiet, honest love.</div>
 <div class="body-text">And maybe one day, when the pain softens and your heart starts to heal, you’ll look back and realize — someone was there, loving you without conditions, without reasons.</div>
 <div class="body-text">And that someone will still be me...</div>
